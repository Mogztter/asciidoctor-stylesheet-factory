This manual assumes you are using Asciidoctor to produce and render your document.
Asciidoctor implements more syntax, attributes and functions than the legacy AsciiDoc.py processor.
<<migrating-from-asciidoc-python>> lists which features are available to the Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc processors.

////
== Navigating this document

The first sections define the general concepts and terms used by Asciidoctor
Next, each Asciidoctor feature, its capabilities, and how it can be customized is reviewed.
And when applicable, the feature's attributes and options are summarized in a table at the section's end.

=== Asciidoctor's Most Notable Benefits

include::{includedir}/benefits.adoc[]

==== AsciiDoc Syntax Processing

Asciidoctor reads and parses text written in the AsciiDoc syntax, then feeds the parse tree into a set of built-in templates to produce HTML5, PDF, DocBook 5, etc.
You have the option of writing your own converter or providing {uri-tilt}[Tilt]-supported templates to customize the generated output or produce alternative formats.

NOTE: Asciidoctor is a drop-in replacement for the original AsciiDoc Python processor (`asciidoc.py`).
The Asciidoctor test suite has > 1,500 tests to ensure compatibility with the AsciiDoc syntax.

In addition to the standard AsciiDoc syntax, Asciidoctor recognizes additional markup and formatting options, such as font-based icons (e.g., [x-]`icon:fire[]`) and UI elements (e.g., [x-]`button:[Save]`).
Asciidoctor also offers a modern, responsive theme based on {uri-foundation}[Foundation] to style the HTML5 output.

.What is AsciiDoc?

AsciiDoc is two things:

. A mature{empty}footnote:[AsciiDoc is over 10 years old. It was first introduced in 2002.], plain-text format for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, ebooks, web pages, slide decks, blog posts, man pages and more.
. A text processor and toolchain for translating AsciiDoc documents into various formats (called _backends_), including HTML, DocBook, PDF and ePub{empty}footnote:[There are two implementations of the AsciiDoc processor. The original processor, named AsciiDoc, is written in Python. A more modern implementation, named Asciidoctor, is written in Ruby.].

AsciiDoc belongs to the family of {markup-ref}[lightweight markup languages], the most renowned of which is {markdown-ref}[Markdown].
AsciiDoc stands out from this group because it supports all the structural elements necessary for drafting articles, technical manuals, books, presentations and prose.
In fact, it's capable of meeting even the most advanced publishing requirements and technical semantics.


Serving as testament of this fact, many O'Reilly authors, including https://github.com/matthewmccullough[Matthew McCullough], https://github.com/tlberglund[Tim Berglund], https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-erlang[Simon St.Laurent] and http://www.apeth.net/matt/iosbooktoolchain.html[Matt Neuburg], have used AsciiDoc to write their books for that iconic technical library.

From the very beginning, AsciiDoc was designed to be a shorthand replacement for http://www.docbook.org/whatis[DocBook], one of the formats AsciiDoc can generate.
AsciiDoc can also produce beautiful HTML 5, PDFs, eBooks, man pages and even slide decks.
It has you covered from first draft to publishing.
